### What does “sovereign infrastructure” mean?

It means owning and operating your critical infrastructure so that availability, data integrity, and governance stay under your control.

### Do you replace all cloud services?

Not necessarily. We identify where local-first or open alternatives deliver the highest impact and build a phased path toward autonomy.

### What does a Digital Autonomy Audit deliver?

A clear inventory of dependencies, a risk profile of centralized exposure, and a prioritized roadmap for remediation.

### Who is this for?

Organizations that need resilient operations, regulated data handling, or full visibility into their digital stack.
